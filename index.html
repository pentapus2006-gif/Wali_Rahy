        <h1>Hachathon</h1>
        <p>A hackathon is a time-limited event, often lasting a day or two, where people collaborate to solve problems, build prototypes, or develop new ideas, typically in a tech-focused context like software development. Participants, often in teams, work intensively to create solutions, improve skills, network, and have fun. Hackathons are used by companies, universities, and other organizations for innovation, talent scouting, and fostering a sense of community.</p>
